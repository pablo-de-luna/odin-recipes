        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These barbacoa tacos are packed with smoky shredded beef that's perfectly tender. Spices like cumin complement the chiles, while oregano and bay leaves add an earthiness to this recipe.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ripe plum tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 small white onion, quartered</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>4 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 (3 pound) beef chuck roast, cut into 6-equal sized cubes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>3 fresh bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lime juice</li>
            <li>corn tortillas, warmed</li>
            <li>2 ripe avocados, peeled, pitted and sliced</li>
            <li>½ bunch radishes, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high. Arrange whole tomatoes, onions (cut-side down), and garlic in the dry skillet in a single layer, working in batches if needed. Cook, turning occasionally, until charred on all sides, about 6 minutes for the garlic and about 12 minutes for the onions and tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Transfer charred vegetables to a blender and add chipotle peppers. Process until smooth, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir salt, chili powder, cumin, and black pepper together in a small bowl; season beef evenly with salt mixture.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef in batches and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer browned beef to a large plate.</li>
            <li>Pour water into the Dutch oven and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Stir in onion-tomato mixture, brown sugar, oregano, and bay leaves. Reduce heat to medium-low and bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Nestle beef back into pot and cover. Cook, stirring and re-nestling beef occasionally (about every 20 to 30 minutes), until beef is tender and pulls easily apart with a fork, 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours and 15 minutes. Remove bay leaves and discard.</li>
            <li>Remove beef from Dutch oven, place on cutting board; shred beef using 2 forks.</li>
            <li>Return beef to the Dutch oven, add lime juice, and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>To serve, place a few pieces of beef on a warm corn tortilla. Top with avocado, radishes, and cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
